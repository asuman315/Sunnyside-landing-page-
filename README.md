# Sunnyside agency landing page

This is a solution to the https://asuman315.github.io/Sunnyside-landing-page-/

## Overview
My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://asuman315.github.io/Sunnyside-landing-page-/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to reverse column elements using CSS. I also did improve on creation
of responsive pages.

```css
 .service:nth-child(odd){
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
    }
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects, I would love to add more interaction to the pages using JavaScript. I will 
also use more of CSS grid.
